# RAG-demo

A Retrieval Augmented Generation demo for building an in house RAG system using Open Source Large Language Models hosted on a local machine, using vector spaces and embeddings stored via Chroma Databases.

This project implements the RAG system using LangChain and the open source Ollama embeddings. The implementation is then served as a Flask API endpoint.
